# HandTrackingProject
Hand tracking only using CPU with mediapipe library by Google. MediaPipe offers open source cross-platform, customizable ML solutions for live and streaming media.
## Finger Counter
We first look into hand tracking and then we will use the hand landmarks to count of the fingers. And all of this will be happening in real-time and requires close to no installations and configurations.

## Gesture Volume Control
Gesture Control to change the volume of a computer. We first look into hand tracking and then we will use the hand landmarks to find gestures of our hand to change the volume. This project is module-based which means we will be using a previously created hand module which makes hand tracking very easy.
## AI Virtual Mouse
AI-based Mouse Controller. We will first detect the hand landmarks and then track and click based on these points. We will also apply smoothing techniques to make it more usable. 
## AI Virtual Painter
We will first track our hand and get its landmarks and then use the points to draw on the screen. We will use two fingers for selection and 1 finger for drawing. And the best part is that all of this will be done in real-time.
